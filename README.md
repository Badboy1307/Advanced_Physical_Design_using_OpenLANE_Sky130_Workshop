## Day-1 Inception of open-source EDA OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK

### How to talk to computers

#### Introduction to QFN-48 Package,chips,pads,core,die and IPs


![141352](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123891647-db16b980-d976-11eb-9b08-95791ae9a9e9.png)


Here we can see an Arduino board which you might have bought from the market and even worked on it. This a typical electronic circuit. But here the field we are talking about is  inside the circled part that is the chip.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123920622-c866a980-d9a3-11eb-9ca3-e74bbe9b3422.png)



This image is the block diagram of the above arduino board image and the circled part in the previous image is shown in this figure as a Processor/SOC. 



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123920490-a1a87300-d9a3-11eb-9a1e-a7089e404348.png)




When we open up the  IC from Arduino Board we will be seeing as the above image. We will be calling this as a package and it's named as QFN 48 (Quad Flat No-leads)


The image shown below shows where our chip will be located and how it's connected to the package.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123919556-a9b3e300-d9a2-11eb-9af8-e7eded559c15.png)



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123921098-4925a580-d9a4-11eb-9929-5c76c11ccbb8.png)

This image shows the inside part of the chip which has pads, cores and dies. Pad is an component through which signal can be sent inside the chip. From the marked parts we see core which in the middle of the chip where all our digital logic circuits sits and logic circuits can be any basic gates, MUX's or can be any different kind of logics. Die is the size of the entire chip.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123922385-9b1afb00-d9a5-11eb-9540-4dd87a3f2c13.png)


This image is the example or sample of RISCV inside a chip.

###### Foundry and Foundry IPs

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123939500-cf96b300-d9b5-11eb-9522-e3c244ded386.png)



This image depicts which are the components present in the above image are foundry related IPs like dac adc0, adc1, pll and SRAM. 

A mobile phone for example depends on the foundry. Foundry is like a factory with alot of machines where chips are manufactured.Then sir had shared his experience on working in a foundry of IIT Bombay where he and his team worked in lithography domain. As VLSI engineers our job is to continuously communicate with foundry.


##### RISCV Introduction


Here we see about RISCV Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) which is a language of the computer and this is the way we are going to talk to a computer. 




![tempsnip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124063611-dde5dd00-da50-11eb-9f73-01bc2fe89c14.jpg)


From the above image we want to pass this C program to a hardware of the above layout in a certain way or in a certain flow. This is done by  firstly compiling C in its assembly language program ie RISCV assembly language program then this assembly language is converted to machine language which is basically the binary 1s and 0s understood by the hardware of the computer.

The above image also shows the output in hexadecimal format which is converted to binary format and finally these bits gets executed in the above layout of the hardware and we receive the required output. 

There is another interface required between RISCV Architecture and the layout of the hardware ie hardware description language which can be Verilog or VHDL or System verilog. We are implementing RISCV Architecture using some RTL but here we take an example of picorv32 cpu core which takes  RISCV Architecture as specifications and implements in hardware description language and finally from the RTL to layout which is nothing but a standard PnR or a standard RTL to GDS fLow.


##### Software Applications to Hardware


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123945643-ffe15000-d9bb-11eb-8d78-48cefe7ba5bf.png)



The above image shows the Apps or Application Softwares used in our PC. These apps run in the computer hardware shown in the below image.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123946253-9f9ede00-d9bc-11eb-88bc-de2c3e39308b.png)




![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124062338-3071ca00-da4e-11eb-990f-7f2a6a185534.png)





The above image shows the flow of Application Software running in Hardware of Computer using System Softwares which consists of OS, Compiler and Assembler.


### SOC and OpenLane

#### SOC Design using OpenLane

This lecture was given by Mohamed Shalan who talked about OpenLane and its features.

Designing digital application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) require certain elements like RTL IP's (which is a hardware description model or functions), EDA tools and 
Process Design Kits (PDKS). The same is shown in the image given below.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123952883-3ae78180-d9c4-11eb-9966-17f0ab7be254.png)




Some of the best websites to acquire RTL Designs include:

librecores.org
opencores.org
github.com

EDA Software tools include Qflow, OpenROAD and OpenLane.


PDK is the interface between FAB and the designers. It includes collection of files used to model a fabrication process for EDA tools used to design an IC such as:

- Process Design Rules: DRC, LVS, PEX
- Device Models
- Digital Standard Libraries
- I/O Libraries


On June 30, 2020 Google on collaboration with skywater technology released the first open source pdk ie 130nm process skywater to the masses.

The above image demonstrates various steps involved in EDA Tools


##### Simplified RTL to GDSII Flow



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123957671-b3047600-d9c9-11eb-974e-dbd6a039eca3.png)



This images shows the Simplified flow from RTL design to GDSII 

###### Synthesis

-Conversion of RTL design to a circuit out of components from Standard cell library (SCL). We have a small sample code of always block as shown below:



           always @ (posedge clk)
             if(c) q<=a;
             else q<=b;
             
             
             
             
![Flow_Workspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123964569-2bbb0080-d9d1-11eb-89bb-4908d7a07f44.jpg)




Standard Cells have regular layout. Each has different views/models 

-Electrical, HDL, SPICE,
-Layout (Abstracted and Detailed) 


###### Floor and Power Planning 


Chip Floorplanning - Patitioning the chip die between different system blocks and placing the I/O pads



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123965874-830da080-d9d2-11eb-8801-bf2c87292754.png)





The above image describes the Chip Floorplanning

Macro Floorplanning - We define the macro dimensions, pin locations and row definitions.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123966387-03340600-d9d3-11eb-8a03-494b72f72228.png)




Power Planning - Power network is constructed typically by multiple VDD and GND pins. the Power pins are all connected through power rings, vertical and  horizontal metal straps.

Power rings- Power ring is designed around the core. Power rings contains both VDD and VSS rings. After the ring is placed a power is designed such that power reaches all the cells easily.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123967363-ddf3c780-d9d3-11eb-8b41-6f8f8ce56882.png)





This diagram shows the power planning components.

These parallel structures reduce resistance. To address electromagnetism the power distribution network uses upper metal layers as they are thicker than lower metal layers


###### Placement 

Placing the cell on the floorplan rows aligned with sites. Connected cells should be placed close to each other to reduce the interconnect delay. It is done in two steps ie Global and Detailed Placement. In global placement , the approximate locations for cells is decided by placing cells in global bins. In detailed placement, cells are Placed without over lapping.




![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123968734-22339780-d9d5-11eb-89eb-0ab9dfc5aca2.png)





###### CTS (Clock Tree synthesis)

Creating a clock distribution network :

-Delivering clock to all sequential elements.
- With Minimum skew 
- In Good shape 
- A tree (H,X etc)



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123969507-eb11b600-d9d5-11eb-9a0d-affcbfc897e5.png)




###### Routing 

Implements interconnects using available metal layers. Metal tracks form a routing grid. Routing uses Divide and Conquer method.

There are two types of Routing ie
-Global routing: Generates routing guides
-Detailed routing: Uses routing guides to implement actual wiring.




![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123969880-40e65e00-d9d6-11eb-82aa-b60741c7a9af.png)



###### Sign Off

-Physical Verifications 

-> Design Rules Checking (DRC)
-> Layout vs Scchematic (LVS)

-Timing Verification

-> Static Timing Analysis (STA)



##### OpenLane and Strive chipsets

Open source ASIC flow tools we need to worry about:

-Tools Qualification
-Tools Calibration
-Missing Tools


Efabless decided to create Open source ASIC implementation and flow called as OpenLane which has a public repo in github and is having Apache Version 2.0 license. This OpenLane started as Open-Source Tape Out experiment. 

Strive-  a family of open everything SOCs ie Open PDK, Open EDA and Open RTL.




![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123983062-32517400-d9e1-11eb-8e73-354059050687.png)





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123989279-5f545580-d9e6-11eb-9bc1-ca51ea4ac738.png)





This image shows the features of Strive SOCS and its features.


The main goal of OpenLane was to produce a clean GDSII without human interventions. So that means, No LVS Violations! NO DRC Violations! or Timing Issues.

OpenLane was tuned for the Skywater 130nm Open PDK. OpenLane is containerized for making it functional out of the box and for building instruction and running natively. Can be used to harden macros and Chips.

It has two modes of operations ie:

-Autonomous -> It is a push button flow where we configure the design and run the design and obtain the final GDSII along with reports for this flow.

-Interactive -> We run individual commands and steps one by one in an ordered fashion without skipping any step so we can do experimentation and get the idea of how our result will look like.

It has the feature of Design Space Exploration where we can find the best set of flow configurations.It has larger number of design examples which ia around 43 designs with best configurations and some more on the way.

This image shows the design exploration details such as design name,total runtime for the design flow, cell counts and other details which is tabulated for users to understand the design explorations.


We can do regression testing for these designs as well. 



###### DFT

This step is optional in OpenLane which includes scan insertions, ATPGS, Test pattern compaction, fault coverge and fault simulation. 





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/123992809-8fe9be80-d9e9-11eb-9826-68a0852fa4c9.png)





###### Logic Equivalence Circuit (LEC)

This check is used to formally confirm that the function did not change after modifying the netlist.


###### Fake antenna diode insertion 

This step is done to deal with antenna violations caused during reaction ion etching which causes charge to accumlate metal wires which in turn damages the transition gates.

### OpenLane Github link 


https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane

This is the link of the OpenLane with the latest version 0.21. 

OpenROAD has 37 repos and OpenLane is one of them. 

This project has a well documented installation procedures and how to work post OpenLane and PDKs installations. 

We have a lot of options and commands for Github like forking, cloning or download a particular repo in .zip format etc. 





## Day-2 Understand importance of good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

### Chip Floorplanning considerations


#### Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio




Core is the section of the chip where the fundamental logic of the design are placed

Die which consist of core is a small semiconductor material specimen on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124116318-75b4ec80-da8c-11eb-91b8-ee30364f44d7.png)


-Netlist occupies the core area leading to 100% utilization.


     Utilization Factor = Area occupied by the Netlist/ Total Area of the core 
       
       
-Whenever the Utilization Factor=1, the core is fully occupied and we are not allowed to ad any extra cells in our design and the core will take square shaped structure.


     Aspect Ration= Height/ Width
       
       
-Whenever the Aspect Ratio = 1, it signifies that the chip is square shaped. But whenever the Aspect Ratio or Utilization Factor is not 1, then  the chip will take rectangular shaped structure.


####  Preplaced Cells

      


![IPs_Workspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124118719-3e940a80-da8f-11eb-8e60-e6f5b8c704b7.jpg)

-The arrangement of IP's in a chip is called Floorplanning.

-These IP's/blocks have user defined locations and so these are placed in chip before automated placement and routing and are called as pre-placed cells.

-Automated placement and routing tools places the remaining logic cells in the design onto the chip.

### Library Binding and Placement  


Libraries are like shelves which can be divided into two sub libraries like one library will have shapes and sizes informations and the other might have delay related informations. 

Steps in Placement is as below 

-Binding netlist with physical cell 

The image below shows different flavors for same flipflop, gates and other netlists which can differ in sizes, shapes or delay relatedninformations.

### Design Steps

-Circuit Design 

In circuit design Step

We take user defined specifications like cell height, supply voltage, metal layers and pin locations in this design step for cell flow 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124155570-4023f980-dab4-11eb-982d-12a04f9ddede.png)


The above image is an example of circuit design step where we use Euler's path concept to construct paths for the layout design.

Thhe equation for the circuit is Fn= ((B+D) +(A+C) + E.F)'


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124156347-28994080-dab5-11eb-9564-c83ea607ead5.png)


The above circuit show the equation for Wp/Lp / Wn/Ln ratio to set Vm which is the threshold voltage of the above circuit.


-Layout Design 

In layout design as we have mentioned in circuit design that we are using Euler's path concept to construct layout. 



So below image is the example of the paths.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124156740-9e9da780-dab5-11eb-84f2-598c3bc5a3f5.png)


The below image explains the euler's path clearly.

This GUNA softwares Takes all the files shown in this sections as inputs and generates outputs as Timing, Noise and  Power .libs.


### Timing Threshold Definitions

Low depicts the values which are close to 0 power supply.

Here in the below concepts we used red line to show inputs and blue for outputs in the graphs.


slew_low_rise_thr- defines the point over the lower side of your power supply which is 0V. Typical value of slew_low_rise_thr is about 20% or can be 30% of bottom power supply.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124162455-14a50d00-dabc-11eb-9337-acdb9c4ff9f0.png)

The above image depicts the slew_low_rise_thr definition.


slew_high_rise_thr- defines the point over the higher side of power supply. Typical value of slew_high_rise_thr is about 20% or can be 30% of top power supply.

## Day-3 Design and characterize one library cell using Magic Layout tool and ngspice




### Lab for CMOS inverter ngspice simulations


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124224442-47362080-db23-11eb-87c8-e6b7689c07ea.png)


The above image shows the ngspice simulator which we are going to use in this lab.


#### IO Placer Revision

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124339904-1dd2ce80-dbcf-11eb-8f79-7b3ab99def93.png)


The above image indicates the location from where we are trying to read picorv32a.floorplan.def to understand about IO placers in the design in floorplan step.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124340035-f3354580-dbcf-11eb-9f29-e188798b524e.png)


From the above image we see that by default pins are placed equidistantly from each other.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124340100-6f2f8d80-dbd0-11eb-9d73-ca2c5502339a.png)


This is the zoomed version of the previous image to show that the pin are placed equidistantly from each other.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124340363-4e683780-dbd2-11eb-87ad-2bad0a0e3484.png)


Here in the image we see FP_IO_MODE is set to 1, 0 for matching mode and 1 for random equidistant pins.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124340446-05fd4980-dbd3-11eb-823c-cd1bcdf1a465.png)


Here we are setting FP_IO_MODE to 2 in the above image. 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124340627-18c44e00-dbd4-11eb-91af-a501b4f8bbc2.png)


This is the layout we will be getting where pins are not equidistant from each other but pins are stacked upon one another.


### SPICE Deck creation and simulation for CMOS Inverter

##### SPICE Deck creation

-SPICE Deck is nothing but the connectivity information about the netlist.

This has the connectivity information, inputs to be provided to the simulator, tap points at which we will take the  outputs etc.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124341467-41e7dd00-dbda-11eb-91b1-8a5f5f566747.png)


We are going to create SPICE Deck for the circuit in the above image.

- Defining component value ie values of PMOS and the NMOS.

Here we have taken W/L ratio for PMOS (M1) and NMOS (M2) to be 0.375u/0.25u and Cload as 10 fF


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124343934-f5f26380-dbec-11eb-8263-050b2a4c2e57.png)

Here the above image is extended circuit of the just previous circuit which has input gate voltage as 2.5V and VDD as 2.5V based on technology used so here we use 0.25u 0r 250nm technology.
cvxz
-Identifying the nodes in the circuit 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124344067-f5a69800-dbed-11eb-885f-9ce7ed60a4ca.png)

This image shows the nodes indicated by blue dotted lines.



-Naming the nodes


From the identifying nodes image we are naming the nodes as in which is between Vin and VSS, out for the node which is connected to Cload of 10fF and vdd as node connecting VDD and Vss and is shown as below 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124344601-d1988600-dbf0-11eb-9d50-abf11ee62221.png)


SPICE Deck is written as shown below: 


    ** Model Descriptions **
    ** Netlist Descriptions **
    M1 out in vdd vdd pmos W=0.375u L=0.25u
    M2 out in 0  0  nmos W=0.375u L=0.25u
    
    cload out 0 10f
    
    Vdd vdd 0 2.5
    Vin in  0 2.5
    
    *** Simulation Commands ***
    .op
    .dc Vin 0 2.5 0.05
    *** .include tsmc _025um_model.mod   ***
    .LIB "tsmc _025um_model.mod" CMOS_MODELS
    .end 
    
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124345300-c3993400-dbf5-11eb-9ae3-ee00055accb6.png)


The above image is the ngspice window.



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124345339-f6dbc300-dbf5-11eb-9b4c-2febf6adad18.png)

The above image shows the technology file of 0.25um technology



![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124345391-2db1d900-dbf6-11eb-8f7b-24d476ed5518.png)


The location of the technology file is passed as command in the above image.

Then we give 

    ngspice2 -> cmosVTC_PMOSwidth_NMOSwidth.cir

Executing the circuit

    ngspice3 -> run
    ngspice4 -> setplot 
    
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124345508-eaa43580-dbf6-11eb-8e34-e31276b60709.png)
   
   This image tells us as to what has happened after passing setplot command. So dc1 is for dc characteristics, op1 for operating point and const for constant values.
   
    ngspice5 -> dc1
    ngspice5 -> display    --->displays nodes in the circuit
    ngspice6 -> out vs in      ---> plotting input node vs output node
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124345641-d876c700-dbf7-11eb-8720-9437e3f8f073.png)

This is the Voltage characteristics of the given CMOS inverters


#### Switching Vm


  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124345749-5509a580-dbf8-11eb-9af0-e685350e905e.png)

This image compares two different devices having different W/L ratios. Even though the switching occurs at different places the waveforms are the same. this shows the robustness of CMOS inverters interms of its apllications
   
   
   Vm is the point where vin=vout
   
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124346008-f8a78580-dbf9-11eb-801e-4cd033fae733.png)


From the image 1st graph had Vm around 0.98V and 2nd one had Vm as 1.25V approximately.

### Inception of Layout Fabrication process



We take a 16-mask CMOS process

-Selecting a substrate

Here we go for P type substrate with high resistivity, doping level as 10^15 cm^-3 and orientation as 100

-Creating active region for transistors

Here we are creating small pockets or buckets as active region on the ptype substrate where we will create pmos and nmos transistors

-> Grow Silicon on Silicon dioxide which acts as an insulator.
-> Deposit a layer silicon nitride.
-> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
-> Then we create  mask1 and UV light is passed through the layer.
-> Washing out photoresist.
-> Removing the mask.
-> Etching the silicon nitride.
-> Etching the resist from the layer.
-> Placed in oxidation furnace.
-> Growing field oxide. This process is called LOCOS.
-> Etching the remaining silicon nitride using phosphoric acid.


- N well and P well formation

For P well formation
-> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
-> Then we create  mask2 and UV light is passed through the layer
-> Washing out photoresist.
-> Removing the mask.
-> Creating P well using Boron by ion implantation.


For N well formation

-> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
-> Then we create  mask3 and UV light is passed through the layer
-> Washing out photoresist.
-> Removing the mask.
-> Creating N well using Phosphorus by ion implantation.


-> Placing the layer consisting of P well and N well in high temperature furnace.
-> diffuse the boron and the phosphorus atoms
->This forms a twin tub.

- Formation of gate terminal

Controlling doping concentration can be done by:

For N well gate formation 

-> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
-> Then we create  mask2 and UV light is passed through the layer.
-> Washing out photoresist.
-> Removing the mask.
-> Introducing boron with lower energy by ion implantation which inturn controls the threshold voltage.

For P well gate formation

-> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
-> Then we create  mask2 and UV light is passed through the layer.
-> Washing out photoresist.
-> Removing the mask.
-> Introducing arsenic with lower energy by ion implantation which inturn controls the threshold voltage.
-> Original oxide is removed/stripped using hydrofluoric acid.
-> Regrowing oxide again to provide high quality oxide.
-> Deposit a polysilicon layer.
-> N type ion implants for low gate resistance.
-> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
-> Then we create  mask6.
-> Etching the resist from the layer.
-> Removing the mask.
->Remaining polysilicon layer outside the photoresist can be etched away.
-> Removing the remaining resist.


-Lightly doped drain formation(LDD)

-> For this we need doping profiles like P+,P- and N along N well and N+, N- and P along P well side.
-> Reasons for these profiles: Hot electron effect and short channel effect.
 
 For N well
 
 -> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
 -> Then we create  mask7 
 -> Washing out photoresist.
 -> Introducing phosphorus by ion implantation. 
 -> Removing phtoresist from n well and apply photoresist and mask8 on pwell.
 -> Removing mask from p well.
 -> Introducing  boron by ion implantation.
 -> We add spacers by depositing a thick SiO2 or Si3N4 layer on the complete structure and then we apply plasma anisotropic etching.
 
 - Source and drain formation 

-> Thin screen oxide is added to avoid channeling during implants.
-> Deposit a layer of photoresist.
-> Then we create  mask9 in Nwell side.
-> Removing mask from nwell after it's exposed to other implants
-> introducing Arsenic byion implantation.

We apply the same process to P well side but now the mask used will be mask10. Then we introduce a p type impurity like boron. We apply high temperature furnace to the structure. 



### Lab for Sky130 basic layer and LEF using inverters


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124351059-db80b000-dc15-11eb-86fd-52987d5d287a.png)

Here in the imageswe highlighted a sub layer and we used the command as below:


    % what
    
    
 Difference between layout and LEF 
 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124351202-990ba300-dc16-11eb-96da-6a8f37fd80e4.png)


The above image is the layout the inverter.

The layout will have all the informations from metal layers,vias and all the logical and other informations.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124351269-fbfd3a00-dc16-11eb-9f7d-6c4dc9dc3afe.png)

 The above image was taken from Nickson Jose's vsdstdcell design repo.
 
 But LEF reveals only the metal layers without exposing any logical part of the design. For Pnr of the cell we don't need any logic of the cell and all we need to know where are the Pr boundaries.

When we set this value as 1 where the area would would increase but the delay will decrease significantly.



These are the Strategies to be set to reduce delay in the design as in the below images

### Power Aware CTS 


Observations:

-2 levels of buffering. 
-At every level, each node driving same load.
-Identical buffer at same level.

The example circuit is as shown below 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124362791-cd9e4f80-dc54-11eb-801d-529677f5f7d0.png)



This image shows our assumptions for the above circuit

Delay table example is as shown below 


Delay table for CBUF 1

Based on assumption in the below image 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124362847-3d143f00-dc55-11eb-8f11-5c54562fbfa1.png)


We round the values meeting 60ff at node A for CBUF 1

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124362874-7b116300-dc55-11eb-9357-b2636c81a592.png)

We round the values meeting 50ff at node B for CBUF 2


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124362928-d2173800-dc55-11eb-913d-cdc62baa8f7c.png)


We round the values meeting 50ff at node B for CBUF 2 for a different input condition 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124362939-f115ca00-dc55-11eb-844c-31d2908cb0f6.png)



### Setup Timing Analysis

Specifications:

Clock Frequency(F)= 1GHZ
Clock Period(T)= 1/F
               =1/1GHZ
               =1ns
               
               
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60011091/124371990-aa02f580-dca4-11eb-84ff-2709db099a0d.png)


The setup timing analysis says that if for this particular circuit to work, the combination delay (θ) ie internal delay of the launch flop and the combinational delay in the above circuit must be less than the time period given in the specifications.

    θ < T
    
For the capture flop to settle with the received data we have to tweak  θ < T so, the condition will look like

    θ < (T-S)
    where S is the setup time of Capture Flipflop
    

### Clock Jitter and uncertainty

Clock Jitter: temporary variation of clock period.

For modeling this jitter we take one more parameter called uncertainty
    
After we introduce this concept,  θ < (T-S) is again changed based on setup uncertainty(SU) so the condition becomes


     θ < (T-S-SU)
     
 ### Clock tree Routing (H Tree Algorithm)
 
 H Tree Algorithm takes a particular clock route and it claculates the distance from a particular point to all its end points and tries to comment on the midpoint and builds a tree from that midpoint.
